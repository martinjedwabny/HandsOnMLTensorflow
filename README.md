# Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and TensorFlow

The book is divided into two parts, Fundamentals of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
The fundamentals part covers areas like classification, clustering, support vector machine, decision trees, ensemble methods, random forests etc in detail. Every topic will have a brief theoretical explanation and coded examples in Scikit-Learn.
Deep learning section covers most areas like TensorFlow setup and basic skills, perception theory, artificial neural networks, convolution neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks.
The CNN and RNN sections cover some advanced topics like LSTM, GRU and standard architectures like AlexNet and GoogleNet.
There is also sections on autoencoders, NLP and reinforcement learning.

This repo provides Jupyter notebooks for the book's chapters. 

## Chapters:
* Chapter 2: End to end machine learning: error metrics, data cleaning, feature scaling, pipelining, custom transformations.
* Chapter 3: Classification.
